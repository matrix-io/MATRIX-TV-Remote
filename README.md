You can visit the new repository here: https://github.com/matrix-io/MATRIX-TV-Remote-Website

# MATRIX-TV-Remote
<b>Current Features:</b>
  - Premade Remote Buttons<br>
  - A counter to show current users connected<br>
  - Mobile friendly (as far as I know)
  
<b>Notes:</b>
  - UI has been updated from what is seen in the demos.
  - I'll be adding more buttons later to make the site more functional.<br>
  - Two buttons have no commands attached to them, but they can be set easily.
  
<b>Setting up</b><br>

<b>1. Make sure that your IR Remote is set up for your Raspberry Pi.</b>
  - Turotial: http://www.instructables.com/id/Universal-IR-Remote-Control-With-MATRIX-Creator/?ALLSTEPS<br>
  - The server works by directly inputting CLI commands.<br>


<b>2. Create an empty folder to store all the files.</b><br>


<b>3. Edit your variables.</b>
  - Set your device in public/script.js (currently set to comacst).<br>
  - The port is set to 8000, but it can be changed in app.js<br>


<b>4. Start the server</b>
  - cd inside the folder you made and use: node app<br>
  
<b>5. Connect to the website</b>
- http://MATRIX_IP:PORT/ <br>
